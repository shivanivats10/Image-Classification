# Image-Classification

**Problem overview**
For an effective approach combining both Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Transfer Learning in classifying images of cats and dogs, you can start with a pre-trained DNN model, such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception, which has already learned rich feature representations from a large and diverse dataset. Then, you adapt this model to our specific task (classifying cats and dogs) by fine-tuning some of its layers with our dataset of cat and dog images. This method utilizes the advanced feature extraction capabilities of DNNs and the efficiency of Transfer Learning, enabling our model to achieve high accuracy with less training data and time.
